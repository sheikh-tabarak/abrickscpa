          <span class="font-semibold text-[#062d60]">A Bricks Coggin CPA, PLLC</span> is a Texas Certified Public Accounting
          firm based in Southlake, Texas. Since being founded in 2017, we have proudly met our goal of providing
          personalized attention to the accounting needs of businesses and individuals in the South, and have since
          expanded to offer the same focused customer service to clients nationwide.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even as we continue to grow, we never outpace the individual needs of our clients, which we consider the true
          cornerstone of the industry and the reason we cherish our reputation as the local business CPA of choice.
        </p>

        <p>
          In line with our attentive solutions, our founding partner and senior associates deliver comprehensive CPA
          auditing services tailored to Non-Profit businesses — a sector currently observing major changes in tax
          guidelines and updated reporting requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          With A Bricks Coggin CPA, PLLC, Non-Profit associations, organizations and foundations have the means to navigate
          these updated requirements without interruption while taking full advantage of the latest suite of benefits.
          Through our Single Audit services, we provide a clear path towards compliance, transparency, and effective
          budgeting — ensuring maximum funding opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our clients are positioned at the forefront of tax and regulatory updates, avoiding non-compliance penalties,
          exemption revocations, and other setbacks — while being fully prepared for upcoming policy changes.
        </p>

        <p>
          We consider it our duty to equip businesses with the knowledge to bolster operations through financial
          awareness and resilience. For organizations without large in-house accounting teams, our Audit Services fill
          that critical gap with expertise and confidence.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, we have stayed in lockstep with emerging technologies that continue to transform the accounting
          landscape. By deploying cutting-edge software and methodologies, we deliver cost-savings, efficiency, and
          accuracy that empower businesses through smarter CPA services.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every engagement is tailored to the specific goals of our clients’ industries, with tools designed to automate
          and process data into clear and actionable answers. Our hands-on approach, backed by technology, ensures we
          reveal the perfect solution for your needs.
