                    <strong>Bricks Coggin</strong> is the owner of A Bricks Coggin CPA, PLLC and serves as associate
                    partner who
                    works directly with our clients in every aspect of our CPA services. Bricks has over 13 years’
                    auditing experience with specialism in non-profit organizations, government, single audits, and
                    manufacturing and construction industries. Notable organizations and agencies where Bricks has taken
                    part include AICPA and the TXCPA.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now a trusted Texas CPA for over 6 years, Bricks offers his extensive experience to the needs of
                    businesses and individuals through a boutique firm that organizes CPA services specifically around
                    the client. With A Bricks Coggin CPA, PLLC, Bricks has the pleasure of meeting with clients and
                    discussing their various financial and business goals while creating personalized strategies just
                    for them. Before founding his own firm, Bricks believed that high-touch CPA services were getting
                    harder and harder to come by for businesses, and that a one-size-fits-all approach actually created
                    disadvantages for businesses on both sides of the scale. That is why he is never too eager to
                    outgrow his firm’s primary purpose. It turns out that’s exactly what people always need.

                <p>
                    Born in Mobile, Alabama, Bricks moved to Texas at the early age of three, but still counts himself
                    as a Very Proud Texan! Bricks enjoys his Texas lifestyle full of family, pets, and the great
                    outdoors. He has four Goldendoodle dogs, named Hono, Lulu, Kiki, and Waialae, and loves to sail,
                    row, and just about anything that gets him out on the water.
